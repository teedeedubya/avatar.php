# avatar.php 

- A little something something I wrote back in the day to gain shell access to a server dumb enough to allow php files to be uploaded

## Requirements

- php..... -_- 

## Mo Description Mo Problems 

- Upload this to any server you're interested in gaining shell access to, THIS IS IN NO WAY A GOOD IDEA.
- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS EVEN STILL WORKS, it was wrote 5 years ago while I was in a security competition.
- It's a simple php script that spits an HTML page which in turn uses AJAX to send your commands back to the target.

- There's definitly better scripts out there for achieving this btw... This is just me virtually scrapbooking
